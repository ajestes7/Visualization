# HW10

Add code to HW-Vis.py.  The instructions are in the file. You will be creating a dictionary with the days of the week as the keys and the number of tweets created on that day in the database as the values.  You will create a bar chart and save it to a file.  You will finish writing the unittest section.  

- Read from the tweets.sqlite database.  
- Commit often and push your files to github by the deadline.  Don't forget to upload the bar chart named bar.png to canvas after you write it.
